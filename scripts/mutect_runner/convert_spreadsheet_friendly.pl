 This script adds double quotes to columns in *-Mutect.txt and MuTect summary files 
 that should be designated as text when importing the tab-delimited file into Excel.
 This is a safegaurd against Excel converting gene names into dates. (Trust me, this has happened)

 Usage: convert_spreadsheet_friendly.pl mutect_tab_file.txt

 Prints to STDOUT.
